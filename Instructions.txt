OBSCURIO — GAME RULES

GAME OVERVIEW

Obscurio is a cooperative, asymmetric game of visual clues and deception. Players are trapped in a magical library and must work together to escape, except one player is secretly a Traitor.

The Grimoire (the magical book) guides the Wizards using image clues. The Wizards try to interpret those clues and find the correct exit door. The Traitor secretly tries to mislead the Wizards.

Victory Conditions:

- Wizards and the Grimoire win if they escape the library.

- The Traitor wins if the Wizards lose all their Cohesion tokens.

COMPONENTS

1. Library board with progress track

2. Grimoire desk and card holder

3. Hourglass timer

4. Trap token bag

5. Illusion cards (door cards)

6. Transparent clue overlays

7. Loyalty cards (Wizard / Traitor)

8. Wizard tokens or markers

9. Cohesion tokens (group life)

10. Butterfly markers (used by Grimoire)

ROLES

GRIMOIRE:
The Grimoire gives clues using images but cannot speak.
It points to symbols or details with butterfly markers.

WIZARDS:
The loyal players. They must interpret the Grimoire’s clues and choose
which door card is the correct exit.

TRAITOR:
Hidden among the Wizards. Their goal is to mislead others into choosing
wrong doors or wasting time. The Grimoire knows who the Traitor is but
cannot reveal it.

SETUP

1. Place the Library board in the center and put the Progress marker on the first room.

2. Choose a player to be the Grimoire and give them the desk, markers, and hourglass.

3. Shuffle the Illusion cards and draw eight into the Grimoire’s hand.

4. Deal loyalty cards so that one player may be the Traitor.

5. Place trap tokens in the bag and set the number of Cohesion tokens according to player count and difficulty.

GAME FLOW

Each round represents a room in the Library.

Step 1: Turn Setup

- Draw a trap token from the bag and apply its effect for this round.

Step 2: Prepare the Riddle

- The Grimoire secretly selects the Exit card (the correct door).

- They draw two random cards and use butterfly markers to point at visual hints related to the Exit card.

Step 3: Traitor’s Interference

- All Wizards close their eyes.

- The Traitor opens their eyes and chooses up to two cards to add confusion among the door options.

Step 4: Choosing the Door

- The Grimoire shuffles the Exit card, Traitor’s cards, and several random ones to create the final display of doors (usually six).

- Wizards discuss and place their tokens in front of the door they believe is correct before the time runs out.

Step 5: Resolution

- If at least one Wizard chose the correct door, advance the Progress marker one room.

- For each Wizard who chose incorrectly, remove one Cohesion token.

- If all Wizards fail, remove additional Cohesion tokens.

- Discard used cards and reset the setup for the next round.

SPECIAL RULES AND VARIANTS

- In two or three player games, there is no Traitor.

- Difficulty can be adjusted by changing the number of Cohesion tokens and trap token frequency.

END OF THE GAME

The game ends immediately when one of the following occurs:

1. Wizards win if the Progress marker reaches the final room and at least one Cohesion token remains.

2. The Traitor wins if all Cohesion tokens are lost before the group escapes.

SUMMARY OF VICTORY CONDITIONS

Wizards + Grimoire Victory:
Escape the Library with at least one Cohesion token left.

Traitor Victory:
Cause the group to lose all Cohesion tokens before escaping.
